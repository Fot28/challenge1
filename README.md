# Challenge1

## Description

Given a starter code for the Horiseon Social Solution Services website, I rework the HTML and CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

In this Challenge1 Project, you can see that all links work and also you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) and check that HTML follows the semantic structure of the HTML elements, tags, and image alt attributes.
